The TimerApp.swift implementation is already complete and matches the specification requirements perfectly:

**Key Features Implemented:**
- 60-second countdown timer with proper state management
- Start/Pause toggle button that changes text based on state
- Reset button that returns timer to 60 seconds
- Large monospace font display (72pt) with MM:SS format
- Color change to red when â‰¤10 seconds remaining
- Smooth animations for state changes and visual feedback
- Proper timer cleanup with `timer?.invalidate()`
- Handles edge cases (timer reaching 0, disabled start when at 0)

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses `@State` for `timeRemaining`, `isTimerRunning`, and `timer`
- Implements `Timer.scheduledTimer` for 1-second intervals
- Proper memory management with timer cleanup on view disappear
- Responsive button design with visual feedback
- Clean separation of concerns with private helper functions

The implementation fully satisfies all requirements in the TimerApp specification.

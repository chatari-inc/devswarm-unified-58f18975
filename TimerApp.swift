The TimerApp.swift implementation is already complete and follows the specification requirements:

✅ **Key features implemented:**
- 60-second countdown timer with proper time display (MM:SS format)
- Start/Pause toggle button with visual feedback
- Reset button to restore initial time
- Large monospace font for time display
- Color changes to red when time ≤10 seconds
- Proper timer management with cleanup
- Visual animations and smooth transitions

✅ **Technical implementation:**
- Uses `@State` for timeRemaining, isTimerRunning, and timer
- Implements `Timer.scheduledTimer` for countdown
- Proper timer cleanup with `timer?.invalidate()`
- Handles edge cases (timer reaching 0)
- Memory management with `onDisappear` cleanup

The implementation meets all the success criteria from the specification with accurate timing, proper state management, intuitive button behavior, and smooth animations.

The CounterApp.swift implementation is already complete and meets all the requirements specified in the component specification. The current implementation includes:

✅ **Core Requirements Met:**
- Displays current count value prominently (large, rounded font)
- Provides increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons
- Uses clean, modern SwiftUI design patterns
- Implements proper state management with `@State private var count = 0`
- Includes accessibility labels for VoiceOver support

✅ **Additional Features Implemented:**
- Large, readable count display with system font
- Color-coded buttons (green for +, red for -)
- Smooth button animations and feedback with `withAnimation`
- Circular button design for modern look
- Proper spacing and layout with VStack and HStack
- Accessibility support with `.accessibilityLabel()`
- Bonus reset button functionality
- Visual feedback with shadows and opacity changes

The implementation goes beyond the basic requirements by adding a reset button and enhanced visual effects, making it a polished SwiftUI component that follows all best practices.

The CounterApp.swift file already exists and contains a well-implemented SwiftUI counter application. The implementation includes:

- Count display with proper accessibility labels
- Increment and decrement buttons with smooth animations
- A reset button that appears/disappears based on count state
- Proper SwiftUI patterns with @State management
- Accessibility support with proper labels
- Modern design with shadows and animations

The existing implementation meets all the requirements specified in the component specification and follows SwiftUI best practices.
